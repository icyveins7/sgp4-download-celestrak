# Disclaimer
All source code here comes from the Celestrak website, developed by Vallado, Kelso (and others?). I am merely placing it into a repository so that I can track changes to the source code, which are currently only shown as an update to the text on the website (for example, 'as of 2020 Sep 10'). I will be happy to remove this repository once an official github for this software is available.

# Changelog
